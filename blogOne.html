            If you’ve long dreamed of watching a very small number of vehicles roll off an assembly line, today’s your
            chance. Tesla is holding a livestream event to highlight deliveries of its long-awaited Cybertruck. The
            company has only managed to manufacture ten of them so far, despite a 2019 reveal, so that’s what we’ll be
            watching.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can catch the Texas-based livestream on X, of course, but the event is also available via Tesla’s
            website. It all goes down at 3PM EST. Being as how there will only be ten trucks to show off, the livestream
            should also go over pertinent details regarding battery range, towing capacity, up-to-date pricing and, of
            course, general availability. Tesla plans on ramping up production in 2024 for the cute lil dystopian wonder
            cars.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s easy to make jokes at the automaker’s expense, given the recent history of its CEO, but this is
            something of a big deal. It’s Tesla’s first truck, despite looking nothing like a classic pickup. The
            aesthetics are absolutely wild, with it resembling something out of a 1970s sci-fi flick instead of
            something you’d spot at a tailgate party. As for performance, it remains to be seen if the Cybertruck can
            compete with rival vehicles in the off-road market.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tesla’s Cybertruck has been plagued with issues from inception. During its 2019 product debut, Elon Musk
            crowed about the unbreakable glass window and invited a customer to try to break it by hurling a bowling
            ball. Well, it shattered, leading to a muttered curse from the embattled CEO. Despite that embarrassment,
            the company still says the vehicle boasts a “nearly impenetrable” exoskeleton that resists dents, damage and
            long-term corrosion. We shall see. There have been multiple delays and a redesign back in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            There’s also the matter of price. When it was first revealed, the Cybertruck was set to cost around $40,000.
            However, the company’s been fairly silent on the subject since then and a lot has changed since 2019. You
            can reserve a vehicle right now from Tesla by plopping down $100, but who knows when actual shipments will
            start. Despite that, Musk recently told investors that it has accrued more than one million reservations.
            Those folks will be waiting a while, as even generous estimates allow for Tesla to manufacture around
            200,000 Cybertrucks each year.
