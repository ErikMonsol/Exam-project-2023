Overview of the Goal: Building a Responsive Website
Objective: Apply your knowledge of HTML and CSS by creating a fully functional, responsive website based on a previous design assignment.

## Description

In my Project Exam 1, I'm taking on the challenge of creating a blog site, leveraging the skills I've learned during my first year of studies. This project allows me the freedom to decide on the design and topics of the blog, but it must include several key pages: a Home page, an About page, a page listing all blog posts, individual blog post pages, and a Contact page.

For the Home page, I'm planning to feature a 'Latest Posts' section. This will be in the form of a carousel for desktop viewers, showcasing a set number of posts at a time, with navigational arrows to scroll through. 

The blog posts page will initially show the first 10 blogs, with an option for users to view more. Each specific blog post page will be dynamically created based on the user's selection, with a changing title to reflect the chosen blog post. Additionally, I'll include a feature where clicking on images opens a modal for an enlarged view.

The Contact page will have textboxes for name, email, subject, and message content, all validated using JavaScript to ensure accuracy and relevance.

A unique aspect of this project is the use of WordPress as a Headless CMS. I'll be using it solely to provide an API and add content for the blog. My task is to build the website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making API calls to WordPress for content. I'm expected to add at least 12 blog posts on WordPress, which can include lorem ipsum text, but should have sensible headings and images.

My process involves deciding on the blog theme, creating a website prototype, setting up WordPress, and developing the site using the specified technologies. I will also install Hotjar for user testing, and make adjustments based on the feedback and insights gathered.

The final deliverables will be a comprehensive report documenting the project, submitted as a PDF, along with links to both the live site on Netlify and the GitHub repository. I also have the option to enhance the blog with additional features like sorting, filtering, and enabling user comments, which would be posted back to WordPress. This is a significant task, as tutor support is limited, emphasizing the exam nature of this project.
