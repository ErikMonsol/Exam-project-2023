            MIT researchers developed an ingestible capsule that can monitor vital signs including heart rate and
            breathing patterns from within a patient’s GI tract. The scientists also say that the novel device has the
            potential to also be used to detect signs of respiratory depression during an opioid overdose. Giovanni
            Traverso, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT who has been working on developing a range
            of ingestible sensors, told Engadget that the device will be especially useful for sleep studies.

            Conventionally, sleep studies require patients to be hooked up to a number of sensors and devices. In labs
            and in at-home studies, sensors can be attached to a patient’s scalp, temples, chest and lungs with wires. A
            patient may also wear a nasal cannula, chest belt and pulse oximeter which can connect to a portable
            monitor. “As you can imagine, trying to sleep with all of this machinery can be challenging,” Traverso told
            Engadget.

            This trial, which used a capsule made by Celero Systems —A start-up led by MIT and Harvard researchers—
            marks the first time ingestible sensor technology was tested in humans. Aside from the start-up and MIT, the
            research was spearheaded by experts at West Virginia University and other hospital affiliates.

            The capsule contains two small batteries and a wireless antenna that transmits data. The ingestible sensor,
            which is the size of a vitamin capsule, traveled through the gastrointestinal tract, and collected signals
            from the device while it was in the stomach. The participants stayed at a sleep lab overnight while the
            device recorded respiration, heart rate, temperature and gastric motility. The sensor was also able to
            detect sleep apnea in one of the patients during the trial. The findings suggest that the ingestible was
            able to measure health metrics on par with medical-grade diagnostic equipment at the sleep center.
            Traditionally, patients that need to get diagnosed with specific sleep disorders are required to stay
            overnight at a sleep lab, where they get hooked onto an array of sensors and devices. Ingestible sensor
            technology eliminates the need for that.

            In 2022, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) alleged that Neuralink and UC Davis, once
            its research partner, had mistreated several monkeys involved with testing Neuralink hardware — subjecting
            them to psychological distress and chronic infections due to surgeries. Reports from both Reuters and Wired
            suggested testing was being rushed due to Musk’s demands for fast results, which led to complications with
            the installation of electrodes — including partial paralysis and brain swelling.
        </p>
        <p>
            For nearly a year, Neuralink was under federal investigation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
            regarding animal welfare violations. The USDA eventually concluded that there was “no evidence” of animal
            welfare breaches in the startup’s trials other than a previous, self-reported incident from 2019 — but the
            PCRM disputed the results of the investigation.

            In November 2023, U.S. lawmakers ask to the SEC to investigate Neuralink for omitting details about the
            deaths of at least a dozen animals who were surgically fitted with its implants.
