            NVIDIA is facing a lawsuit filed by French automotive company Valeo after a screensharing blunder by one of
            its employees. According to Valeo's complaint, Mohammad Moniruzzaman, an engineer for NVIDIA who used to
            work for its company, had mistakenly showed its source code files on his computer as he was sharing his
            screen during a meeting with both firms in 2022. Valeo's employees quickly recognized the code and took
            screenshots before Moniruzzaman was notified of his mistake.
        </p>
        <p>
            To note, Valeo and NVIDIA are working together on an advanced parking and driving assistance technology
            offered by a manufacturer to its customers. Valeo used to be in charge of both software and hardware sides
            of the manufacturer's parking assistance tech. In 2021, however, the the bigger corporation won the contract
            to develop its parking assistance software. Valeo wrote in its lawsuit that its former employee, who helped
            it develop its parking and driving assistance systems, had realized that his exposure and access to its
            proprietary technologies would make him "exceedingly valuable" to NVIDIA.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moniruzzaman allegedly gave his personal email unauthorized access to Valeo's systems to steal "tens of
            thousands of files" and 6GB of source code shortly after that development. He then left Valeo a few months
            later and took the stolen information with him when he was given a senior position at NVIDIA, the complaint
            reads. He also worked on the very same project he was involved in for Valeo, which is why he was present at
            that video conference.
        </p>
        <p>
            Valeo said its former employee admitted to stealing its software and that German police found its
            documentation and hardware pinned on Moniruzzaman's walls when his home was raided. According to Bloomberg,
            he was already convicted of infringement of business secrets in a German court and was ordered to pay
            €14,400 ($15,750) in September.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a letter dated June 2022, NVIDIA's lawyers told the plaintiff's counsel that the company "has no interest
            in Valeo's code or its alleged trade secrets and has taken prompt concrete steps to protect [its] client’s
            asserted rights." Valeo still sued the company earlier this month, however, and said that NVIDIA has "saved
            millions, perhaps hundreds of millions, of dollars in development costs, and generated profits that it did
            not properly earn and to which it was not entitled" by stealing its trade secrets.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is but another proof that competition continues to heat up in the autonomous driving market. Back in
            2017, Waymo accused Uber of colluding with its former employee, Anthony Levandowski, to steal over 14,000
            confidential and proprietary design files. Levandowski was sentenced to 18 months in prison, but he was
            pardoned six months later by then President Donald Trump.
