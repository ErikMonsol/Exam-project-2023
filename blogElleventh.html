            The margin of success in Formula 1 often comes down to tiny measurements of time and distance. Drivers know
            the exact lines to take at corners for optimal lap times. Sometimes, though, racers will go out of bounds as
            they try to gain an advantage. To help officials check whether a car's wheels entirely cross the white
            boundary line, F1 will test an AI system.

            The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the motorsport's governing body, says it will employ
            Computer Vision tech at the season-closing Abu Dhabi Grand Prix this weekend. This approach uses shape
            analysis to determine the number of pixels that cross the line at the edge of the track.
        </p>
        <p>
            The FIA doesn't plan to fully automate reviews of track limits breaches for the time being. Rather, it wants
            to significantly reduce the number of potential rule violations that are sent to officials for manual
            review.

            As Reuters notes, July's Austrian Grand Prix saw four people having to review around 1,200 potential
            violations. After some track limit violations went unpunished in October's US Grand Prix, officials
            acknowledged they'd have to find a new approach. Enter Computer Vision.

            This tech has been used in medicine to help review data from cancer screenings. "They don’t want to use the
            Computer Vision to diagnose cancer, what they want to do is to use it to throw out the 80 percent of cases
            where there clearly is no cancer in order to give the well-trained people more time to look at the 20
            percent," Tim Malyon, the FIA's deputy race director and head of remote operations, said. "And that’s what
            we are targeting."
        </p>
        <p>
            The FIA hopes to reduce the number of possible infringements that officials manually review to around 50 per
            race. The aim is to "remove the ones that clearly don’t need a human review," Malyon said.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the FIA won't rely entirely on AI to make race calls anytime soon, Malyon expects that to happen
            eventually. "I’ve said repeatedly that the human is winning at the moment in certain areas. That might be
            the case now but we do feel that ultimately, real time automated policing systems are the way forward."
